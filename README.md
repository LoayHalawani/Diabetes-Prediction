# Description

Prolonged exposure to high blood sugar levels damages retinal blood vessels, which leads to diabetic retinopathy, one of the main causes of blindness in individuals with diabetes. The manual inspection process used in traditional screening procedures by ophthalmologists takes a lot of time and resources. By using machine learning models for early detection, screening effectiveness is increased, allowing for prompt intervention to halt the progression of the disease. Benefits include reduced risk of vision impairment, early intervention, affordable screening, enhanced accessibility, efficient use of resources, and scalability to meet the increased prevalence of diabetes worldwide. All things considered, a machine learning approach supports public health objectives by resolving a pressing problem and improving healthcare effectiveness.

# Dataset

The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes 768 instances (patients) with 8 features (diagnostic measurements).

# Models

The machine learning models used are Pruned/Unpruned Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-means Clustering. The SVM model stood out as the best performing model.
